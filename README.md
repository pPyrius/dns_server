I was really curious to study the DNS protocol and develop a dns server from scratch, this can manage only A request DNS
It has been really cool to develop by studying RFC and reading english wikipedia that has a good documentation about the structure of the DNS protocol
It has been a cool exercise to manage bitfields in C
